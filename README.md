## Why I used:
Strapi: I wanted to create a Blog website with Strapi. Strapi provides a great CMS system for storing articles and categories.

Tailwind: The UI and design was not very complex so using Tailwind saved a lot of space and time.

GraphQL: Strapi is an external and nested API. I did not need all the data the API was providing so I needed to filter it with GraphQL.

Apollo: Apollo is easy to work with when I was trying to implement GraphQL for the project.

Material UI: This library saved me a lot of time with their components so I did not need to style my own.
